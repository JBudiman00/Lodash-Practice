# Lodash-Practice
Complex exercises using Lodash.
https://github.com/ManuLintz/lab-javascript-lodash-exercises - the github project that gave out the exercises

This project contains the code required to do the four exercises listed in the above github repository. 
They were actually quite difficult, and it took me a while to formulate a plan of action for these exercies.
The third exercise especially was difficult, as the prompt asked for multiple, separate inclusions to be put together. 

Everything is done through the terminal window for simplicity and because the focus is task-solving, not GUI. 
To run the project, simply enter 'node index.js'

This project is written in Typescript, with Lodash being the only library used.

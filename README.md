# Lodash-Practice
Complex exercises using Lodash.
https://github.com/ManuLintz/lab-javascript-lodash-exercises - the github project that gave out the exercises

This project contains the code required to do the four exercises listed in the above github repository.

The third exercise especially was difficult, as the prompt asked for multiple, separate inclusions to be put together.
